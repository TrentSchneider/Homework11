## Installation

There is no installation needed as this is a website that can be accessed from any web browser.

## Usage

When the site loads, the user is presented with a welcome screen with what the site is. After clicking the "Get Started" button, the user is taken to a page where they are able to add, delete, update, and store text notes.

## Credits

All other code was created by Trenton Schneider. You can find Trenton's work on Gihub at https://github.com/TrentSchneider
